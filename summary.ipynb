      "Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra NEPAL Country profile: 1) General information of Nepal Formal Name: The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. Nepal is a landlocked country and the world’s youngest republic. The establishment and declaration of a federal dem ocratic republic is 28 May 2008 by the elected constitution assembly. Nepal has always been an independent and sovereign country with glorious history, culture and tradition that date back to time immemorial. Nepal is characterized by a rugged topogr aphy, very high relief, variable climatic conditions, complex geological structure wit h active tectonic process and continued seismic activities. It is situated in centra l part of the Himalayan belt. It is situated between the latitudes of 26’22’’to 30’27’’north and the longitudes of 80’ 4”to 88’12’’ east. It covers a landmass area of 147,181sq km and 4,000 sq.km Inland water bodies lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. It is located in so uth Asia occupied only 0.01% of the total landmass of the Earth. It is bordered on the north by People’s Republic of China and on the south, east, and west by the Republic of India. The elevation of the country rises from 60m tarai (Kechanakalan, Jhapa) to 8,848 m Mount Everest in the north withi n a short horizontal distance of 90 to 120 sq.miles. Such a sharp vertically renders the country hi ghly vulnerable to potential water induced disasters like landslide, slope failure, soil erosion and debris flow etc. The mountains and hills of the country occupy about 83% of the total area whereas remaining 17% is covered by low and flat land stretching in the southern part of the country up to the Indian border. It is commonly divided into the three ph ysiographic areas: (1) the mountains and hills region situated in the great Himalayas ran ge makes up the northern part of Nepal .It contains the highest elevatio n in the world including 8,848m (29028) ft. height Mount Everest (sagarmatha in Nepal) on the border of north Tibet, (2) the hills (pahad, mahabharat, chure, shiwalik) regi on about the small mountains an d varies from 1,000 to 4,000 m (3,300-13,125ft.) in a altitude with s ubtropical to temperate climate depending or elevation, and (3) terrain the sout hern low land placi ng bordering India. Nepal is administratively divided into five development regions, 14 zones, 75 districts, 58 municipalities and 3,913 village development committees. It is an ethnically diverse Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra country, with several races, castes, tri bes, and rituals. 102 et hnic groups, 92 spoken languages and religious people are living with the harmony and united. The Nepalese population is consists of indo Aryan and Mongol races. The overwhelming major religions are Hinduism (80.6%), Buddhism (10.7%), Islam (4.2%), kirat Mundhum (3.6%), Christians (0.5%), and the others (0.4 %) . In March 2008 Nepal is declared as a secular state. The country has approximately 29 million (upto2008) populations with annual growth rate of 2.25% average. Nepal is the world’s 41st most populous and 93rd largest country by landmass, and 115th largest economy of the world. Life expectancy rate about 64 years literacy rate about 68%. Net primary en rollment rate was 90% in up to 2008. The fertility rate in Nepal was 4.4% (2.1% in urban and 4.4% in rural). Crude birth rate was 33.58 on 1,000 of life births. N epal is multilingual, multicul tural, multi-religious, and multiethnic society. Nepal is diverse li nguistic heritage evolved from four major languages groups – indo Aryan, tibeto bar men, mangolian, and indigenous language isolates. Urban population in the country comprises 16% of t he total owing to migration from the mountainous to the plain or town. As for economy of Nepal, Gross Domestic Pr oduct (GDP) for the year was estimated at over US$12 billion (adjusted to nominal GDP) which entit les the 115th largest economy in the world. Agriculture comprises 41% of Nepal’s GDP, and in dustry does 22%. Per capita income is less than US$470. Nepal’s ex ports are mainly carpets, clothing, leather goods, jute goods and grain. Import commoditi es are mainly gold, machinery, and equipment petroleum products and fertilizer. Nepal has five climatic conditions/zones from subtropical to arctic broadly corresponding to the altitudes. The tropical a nd subtropical zone lie s below 1200 meters, the temperate zone 1200 to 2400 meters, the cold zone 2400 to 3600 meters, the subtractic zone 3600-4000 meters, and t he arctic zones above 4400 meters. Nepal has four major seasons: 1) winter (D ecember-February), 2) spring (March-May), 3) summer (June-August), and 4) autumn (Septem ber–November). M onsoons are from June to till mid-September and about 80% of the rainfall is brought during that period. Therefore the rest of the year is rather dry. Spring and autumn are the most pleasant seasons. Winter temperature drops to freezi ng with a high level of snow fall in the mountains. Summer and late spring temperatur e range from 28’c (83’ f) in the hills region to more than 40’c (104’f) in the terrain. In winter, maximum and minimum temperatures in the terrain range from brisk 7’ c (45’f) to mild 23’c (74’f). The central valley experience minimum te mperature often falling below freezing point and a chilly 12’c (54’f) maximum. Much colder tem perature prevails at higher elevations. Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra 2) Natural hazards in Nepal 2.1 Natural Hazards likely to affect the Country Flood, landslide, fire are the most frequent natural disaster in Nepal and this year epidemic of diarrhea also affected the country . These disasters occur almost every year in one part of the country t he other causing loss of life and heavy damage to physical properties. Nepal has unfavorable natural condi tions like fragile geology and steep topography make as one of the mo st disaster prone country in the world. It faces high magnitudes and intensities of a multitude of natural hazards such as flood, landslide, earthquake, fire, hailstone, windstorm, av alanches, thunderbolt, and Glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF), cl oudburst, drought and epidemics .

Landsli de usually occurs as secondary effects of heavy rainfall and earthquakes. The materials t hat compose landslides are divided into two classes, bedrock of soil (earth and or ganic matter debris). A landslide may be classified by its type of move ment in the following: (1) fa lls: a fall is mass of rock or other material that moves downward by fa lling or bouncing thr ough air. (2) Slides: sliding of rocks and debris results from shear failure (slippage) along one or several surfaces. (3) Topples: toppling of rocks takes place due to overturning forces that cause a rotation of the rock out of its original position. (4) Lateral spreads: lateral spreads involves spreading out horizontally large blocks of soil by fracturing off the original base. (5) Flows: flows move like a viscous fluid, sometimes very rapidly, and can cover several times. Water is not essential for flow s to occur, however, mo st flows form after periods of heavy rainfall. Mudf low contains at least 50 percent of sand, silt, and clay particles. A debris flow is slurry of soils , rocks and organic matter combined with air and water. The causes of landslide in N epal are natural as well as manmade. Geomorphology of Nepal is very fragile and most of the parts of country fall under seismically active zone. In general the middle hills are prone to landslides. The natural phenomena like heavy rainfall, active geot ectonic movements, deforestation and disturbance of hill slopes are also the major causes for occurring landslides . Landslide in Ramechap district, Nepal Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra Landslides at Kris hnabhir Dhading Nepal b) Floods :- Flood occurs when channel water overcomes the bank full discharge and water overflows to the land that is normally dry. Floods are naturally occurring hazards. A flood hazard is probability of occurrence of a flood of certain magnitude that will happen at a certain location within a specific period of time. They become disastrous when they affect the human se ttlements. The area immediate vicinity of the river banks has also potentiality of sedi mentation from the flooding mate rials. The topographical feature of Nepal is mainly re sponsible for flood. Flood is caused by heavy precipitation which may occur at any place except high Himalayan region during the monsoon season. Inundation along the river banks and erosion of land along the riverbanks causes loss by damaging irrigation and communications facilities and fertile lands across or adjacent to the riverbanks. Such phenomenon’s have caused loss of lives and property in mountainous areas of Nepal an d have posed severe hazards to physical infrastructure like roads and bridges. Inundati ons have disrupted social and economic development of many parts of terrain region in the country. The flood of august 2008 in Koshi river was the most devastating .The fo llowing types of floods are observed in Nepal: (1) Monsoon floods (2) Flash floods Koshi flood 2008 Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra c) Earthquake The Nepalese people are living in a country of highest seismic hazard, have faced the consequences of many earthquakes includi ng those of great ear thquakes.Nepal 45 million years ago, the Indian c ontinent collided into Souther n Tibet. The Indian continent is driven under Tibet, pushing lightweight sediments upwards and thus the formation of the Himalayas. Nepal sits across the boundary between India and southern Tibet which are still moving towards each other by 2 mete rs per century. This movement creates pressure within the Earth, which bui lds up and can only be released through earthquakes. This is the only way eart hquakes can happen in Nepal. Earthquakes happen very often in Nepal. Based on the seismi c record of the number of earthquakes that occurred since 1255, earthquakes of magnitude greater than 8 occurred on average once every 80 years. The last great earthquake of magnitude 8.3 occurred in 1934. The seismic record of Nepal is availabl e since 1255 AD in wh ich 7.7 reactor scale in Kathmandu valley king Avaya Malla and one third of population lost their lives in this event. After that, a series of earthquake o ccurred in Nepal. Major are in 1260,1408, 1681, 1767,1810,1823, 1833,1834, 1866, 1934, 1980 and 1988 AD. According to the seismological center of N epal medium and small size ear thquake event occur in a different part of Nepal frequently. Earthquake (1934 and 1988) Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra In terms of the per capital risk, people livi ng in the Kathmandu valley is 200 times more at risk than people living in Kobe, Japan. As explained in the graphical images below. (Source: NSDRM, 2008) Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra d) Fire Forest fires occur annually throughout Nepal and area major cause estimated 1.7% deforestation annually. these fire causes economic losses and environmental degradation throwing dedicate ec osystems out of balance ad threatening valuable and endangered flora and fauna degrading the soil and inducing flood and landslide. Most of the fire incidents are cause by neglecting the people .the interface between agriculture and forestry requires polices and approaches that tr anscend each economic sector. Hunting practices are responsible for 23% of forest fires in community forest, cigarette 19%, intentional fire to accelera te growth of grasses to feed livestock 18%,intentional fire setting by herb and charcoal collectors 8% and 5% ,children playing with fire 8% deliberating set for prevent ion 6-8 unknown 4%. Ce rtain type of trees especially Sal (shores Robusta) is particularl y susceptible to fire. About 86% of the population of the country inhabit in the rural areas mainly in thatched houses closely clustered where fire hazards are likely to be common. The forest fire and house fire usually outbreaks during dry season. Fire in Bhutanese refugee camp 2008 Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra e) Glacier Lake Out burst Flood (GLOF) Glacier lakes are like natural water reserv oirs dammed by ice or moraines. A lake outburst can be triggered by se veral factors: ice or rock avalanches, the collapse of the moraine dam due to the melting of ice buried wit hin, the washing out of fine material by springs flowing through the (pip ing) earthquakes or sudden inpu ts of water into the lake e.g. through heavy rains or drai nage from lakes further up glac ier. Scientists from the United Nations Environment Pr ogram (UNEP)and International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMO D)identified 3252 glaciers and 2323 glaciers lakes in Nepal out of which they estima te around 20 to be potentially dangerous. GLOF affects high Himalayan region as well as downstream by extremely damages of lives and properties. Major events shown in past were Tamor Koshi (1980), Sun Kosi (1935, 1981), Dudh Kosi (1977, 1985), Arun (1968, 1969, 1970) etc. Now Tsho Rolpa and Emji GlacierLake are in most vulnerable stage acco rding to researcher. Some glacier and glacier lakes in Nepal Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra f) Others In June and July 2009 Midwestern Nepal nearly 300 people died by the epidemic of diarrhea, and other disast er are drought, hailstone, thunderbolt, avalanche, boat capsize, structure collapse, cold wave, ho t wave, swine flu, bird flu, encephalitis, meningitis is common during hot and rainy s eason. The lightening, hailstorm are other natural disaster. The s udden avalanche and heavy snow fall in winter season sometimes cause heavy loss of human lives and properties. Swine flu protection bird flu in eastern region 2009 Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra Drought in Nepal 2008 An scenario of past disastrous events during 1971-2008 reveals that epidemics, landslide and floods takes the la rgest toll of life every year , and urban or rural fire are the principle hazards in terms of their ext ent and frequency of occurrence as well as the spread and intensity of physical and soci o-economic impacts. Earthquake is a major potential hazard to reckon with – the country is located on an active seismic belt and the exponential urbanization trend over the past decade with general disregard of earthquake-resistant measures in building construction is t he cause of ever-increasing earthquake risk. Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra g) Recent major disasters in Nepal:- (1) Udaipur earthquake (august 1988) on 20 august 1988, a strong earthquake (m 6.7) occurred near the border of India killed 721, injured 6500, affe cted 301,016 with 22,000 houses completely destroyed, 22 district a ffected and loss 5 billion Rs. In properly damage and the risk could not be ignored anymore. (2) Koshi flood 2008 Torrential rain that start ed in the beginning of august 17,2008 killed more than 20 and missing more than 50 injured 200, affect ed approximately 150000 thousand and 20000 household completely destroyed nearly $3 billion in proper ly damaged and loss. (3) Landslide (August 2007) Floods and landslides triggered by torrentia l rains in August 2007 killed 203, affected 106,000 households, and 75,000 houses were either destroyed or damaged. 5) Disaster Risk Reduction Manage ment system and Framework: A) System Legal system Natural Calamity Relief Act, 1982 - the sole legal instru ment to define disaster and reduce disaster risk  Covers disaster mitigation measures to earthquake, fire, sto rm, flood, landslide, heavy rain, drought, famine, epidemic, and other similar natural disaster.  The Act also includes industrial accident or accidents caused by the explosions or any other kinds of disaster  Set up for different institutions for disaster response o Central Disaster Relief Committee o Regional Disaster Relief Committee o District and Local level Relief Committees  Funding arrangements for mobiliz ation and relief operations  To facilitate rescue and relief operations at international levels, Nepal has ratified the conventions o Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations ,P rivileges and Immunities to Specialized Agencies Legal Framework i) In 1982 the Natural Disaster Relief Act came into existence, which was amended thrice enunciating the significance of the pre-di saster and post disaster activities. It is the legal instrument for handling disaster in the country. A new DRR act has been Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra drafted and in pipeline for t he approval which covers all aspects of sustainable Disaster Risk Reduction, linking disaster with dev elopment and climate risk management. ii) Soil and water conversation act 1982. ii) Local Self Governance Act, 1999 (has giv en authorities and responsibility to the local authorities (district developm ent committees, muni cipalities, and village development committees) iii) Building Code, 1994 and Nepal building act 2064 (amendment) - (made compulsory in municipal areas) iv) Environmental protection act 1996 (for environmental disast er, climate change) iv) And other sectoral Ac ts, Rules and Regulations. B) Policies For the first time in Nepal’s history, Go vernment of Nepal ha s included Disaster Management Programs in the 10th National Deve lopment Plan (2002-2007) consists of two separate chapters on disaster mana gement. Chapter 17 emphasizes on the irrigation and water induced disaster preparedness, where as chapter 22 deals on population, environment and natur al disaster management. Both the chapters reiterate on policy formulation, strengthening inst itutional mechanism, risk assessment, information collection and dissemination etc .Both the chapters also emphasized on the low costs disaster resilience construction practi ces, similarly, the three year interim plan (2007/08-2009/10) also has giv en separate chapter (chapter 26) on natural disaster management. The interim plan emphasizes on policy formulation, strengthening institutional mechanism, EWS, coordinated approach for DRR and linking disaster management with climate change, etc. and it is hoped that this attempt would be a landmark in the history of Disaster Management. 1) The 10th plan had set its objective as \"to contribut e substantially to make the public life secure by managing the natural and manmade disaster systematically and effectively and by making the development and construction related programs in the country sustainable, reliable an d highly gainful.\" To achiev e the objective the following strategies have been adopted: While formulating plans and policie s on natural and m anmade disaster management, emphasis will be give in to the use and development of technologies that lessen harm on natural disaster and environment. Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra  The relief and rescue activities that are pr ovided to the disast er affected families by the state will be made transparent. Emphasis will be give to enhance awareness regarding natural disaster management.  The seismological measurement center and the natural disaster management center established in t he country will be strengthened. To support the strategies mentioned above, the following policy and programs will be operationalised during the plan period: Use of technologies to minimize the risk of natural disaster and env ironmental impact in the formulation of plans and policies.  Reliable measures will be taken in rescue and relief activities.  Strengthening of seismological measur ement center and natural disaster management. 2) 3 Years Interim Plan , 2007-2010 has following vision, objectives, strategies and programs set out for Di saster Risk Management: Long Term Vision The vision is to minimize social and economic loss and damage caused by disasters. Objective The main objective is to promote the secu rity of life and property from the hit of natural disasters through sustainable, env ironment-friendly and result oriented development by making disaster managem ent practices efficient, competent, strengthened and effective. Strategies The following strategies will be adopted fo r the management of disasters:  Emphasis will be given to develop and apply environment-friendly systems in development and construction works.  For the mitigation of risks of natural disaster, appropriate information flow and pre- disaster pr eparedness will be made.  To strengthen collaborative wor ks between the government, non government and private sect or for rapid response and recovery to those affected by disaster. Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra Policy and Working Policies  Provisions relating to EIA and nat ural disaster assessment will be strengthened prior to the implementation of infrastructure construction.  Timely reforms will be made on policy and institutional mechanisms in relation to the mitigation of risk of natural disasters.  Appropriate mechanisms will be develo ped to strengthen the collaborative works among the government, non-governm ent and private sector in order to deliver the quality service on re sponse and recovery measures to the people affected by disasters.  Awareness programs will be run to enhance the partici pation of the community organizations and the general public in order to mitigate and reduce the risks of natural disasters.  Emphasis will be given to pre-disast er preparedness by advancing the process of identifying ar eas with high risk from disasters and their mapping works.  To strengthen the Ministry of Home as a competent central coordinator for the disaster management by enhancing t he capacity of agencies and human resources associated with disaster management.  Technology for making weather and clim atic forecasts robust will be used.  Soil erosion, landslides, flood and river control works will be implemented in an effective way. Programs  National strategy formul ation and implementation  Awareness programs  Disaster competence enhancement program  Rescue, relief and rehabilitation prepar edness programs for the disaster affected area  Study and research program  Risk Hazard zone mapping and scooping  Storage of relief and rescue materials  Enhancement of the involv ement of local bodies and communities in the prevention works on landslide, ri ver control and soil erosion.

Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra The Main functions and duties of the District Disaster Relief Committee are: A) To coordinate or direct to coor dinate among local committees regarding the natural disaster relief works. B) To formulate district level plan on natur al disaster relief works and submit such plans to the regional committee. C) To monitor the natural disaster relie f work conducted by the Local Committee and supports the ongoing works. D) To provide information to Regional Commi ttee related to natural disaster relief works from time to time. E) To work in accordance with the direct ives of the Central and Regional Committee. (iv) Local Disaster Relief Committee: Formulate as per requirement and will responsible for response and recovery. Even though the establishment of Disaster Relief Committees at the central, regional, district and local level is possible, the co mmittees at the centra l level (CDRC) and district level (DDRC) are functional and the lo cal level (LDRC) have yet to operate on a regular basis. Efforts are underway to oper ationalise the regional (RDRC), which is chaired by the Regional Administrator. As per the Act the other partners in this process are various Ministries, National Planning Commission and Non Government Organizations are also included in the present setup. Department of Water Induced Disaster (DWI DP) has been established to give special focus on water induced disaster and mitigate the adverse effect from it under the Ministry of Water Resources, lik ewise Department of Mines and Geology for seismological hazards. Nepal is taking actively participants on the activities of UNISDR, ADRC, ADPC, SDMC, and other national and international agencies for Disaster Risk Reduction. 5) Budget size on nati onal level in Nepal In Nepal the resources for disaster risk reduc tion are not allocated on priority basis. For the last several decades, government of Nepal has been allocati ng small amount of resources annually primarily fo r relief and rescue activities. There is no any predictable amount of budget allocated for DRR in the c ountry but mobilizing according to the Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra contingency need and necessary basis. However several governmental departments such as water induced disaster prevention, soil conservation and water shed mgmt etc have been implementing activities related to disaster management. In the fiscal year 2009-2010, the national budget for disaster mgmt was approximately Rs 4billion 440million. This is small amount of total budget of the total general account budget expenditure. The budget was allocated to the fields of I) relief and development rehabilitation for fl ood affected areas:- (koshi,mid,and( kailali)far west ern region) Rs: 1billion 300 million. ii) Disaster prevention rescue and relief Rs: 50 million. iii) National land conservation and m anagement Rs: 1 billion 490 million. Iv) Soil conservation and waters hed management Rs: 200 million v) Water induced disaster management:- (River training work, construct embankment) RS 1billion 400 million Total: - Rs 4billion 440million Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra 6) National Progress of the implementa tion of Hyogo framework for Action in Nepal : Nepal is a most vulnerab le and disaster prone country in the world. Disaster management aims to reduce, or avoid the potent ial losses from hazards, assure prompt and appropriate assistance to vi ctims of disaster, and ac hieve rapid and effective recovery. The Disaster management cycle illu strates the ongoing process by which governments, businesses, and civil society pl an for and reduce the impact of disasters, react during and immediately following a disa ster, and take steps to recover after a disaster has occurred. Appropriate actions at all points in the cycle lead to greater preparedness, better warnings, reduced vulner ability or the prevention of disasters during the next iterati on of the cycle. The complete di saster management cycle includes the shaping of public policies and plans that either modify the causes of disasters or mitigate their effects on people, property, and infrastructure. The mitigation and preparedness phases occu r as disaster m anagement improvements are made in anticipation of a disaster event. Developmental considerations play a key role in contributing to the mitigation and preparation of a community to effectively confront a disaster. As a disaster occurs , disaster management actors, in particular humanitarian organizations become involved in the immediate response and long-term recovery phases. The four disaster m anagement phases illustrat ed here do not always, or even generally, occur in isolation or in this precise order. O ften phases of the cycle overlap and the length of each phase greatly depends on the severity of the disaster. o Mitigation - Minimizing the effects of disaster. Examples: building codes and zoni ng; vulnerability analyses; public education. o Preparedness - Planning how to respond. Examples: preparedness plans; emergen cy exercises/training; warning systems. o Response - Efforts to minimize the haz ards created by a disaster. Examples: search and rescue; emergency relief. o Recovery - Returning the community to normal. Examples: temporary housing; grants; medical care. But every year thousands of people are losing their lives due o the natural disaster. So Nepal has legally started to ta ckle disaster by the natural ca lamity act 1982. In the act is giving the priority of rescue and relief activi ties but now the new disaster concept has started to preparedness, prevention, mitigation, response, recovery, rehabilitation, is In viewing weak infrastructure development, so cio-economic condition of Nepal there is a need to focus more on less expensive and su stainable Structural and non-structural counter measures, that can also help rais e the overall awareness level of local Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra communities towards disasters risk reduction. For the disaster risk reduction Nepal has committed the Hyogo framework for action 2005-2015 and the following activities are started to achieve the goals of HFA. In October 11 2009 govern ment of Nepal has approved the national strategy for disaster risk management (2009) which includes the clear cut roles and responsibility of disa ster management cycle and establishment of new autonomous body on national disaster management authority headed by prime minister. Among others the recent prioritized effort s for the implementation of the HFA in Nepal are as follows: Strategic goals 1 A) The more effective integr ation of disaster risk consi derations into sustainable development policies, planning and programming at all levels, with a special emphasis on disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness and vulnerability reduction. First time in Nepal's history, the Tenth National Development Plan (2002-2007) consists of two separate chapters on disaster management. Chapter 17 emphasizes on the irrigation and water induced disaster preparedness, where as chapter 22 deals on population, environment and natur al disaster management. Both chapters reiterate on policy formulation, strengthening institutional mechanism, risk assessment, information collection and dissemination, et c. Both the chapters also emphasized on the low costs disaster resilience construction practices. Similarly, the Three Year Interim Plan (2007/08-2009/10) also has a s eparate chapter (chapter 26) on natural disaster management. The interim plan emphasizes on policy formulation, strengthening institutional mechanism, EWS, coordinated approach for DRR and linking disaster management with climate change, etc. B) The development and strengt hening of institutions, mec hanisms and capacities at all levels, in particularity the community level t hat can systematically contribute to building resilience to hazards. Ministry of Home Affairs is leading agency for disaster management activities with other eight key sect oral ministries namely; Agri culture; Education; En vironment, Science and Technology; Health; Local Developmen t; Physical Planning and Works; Water Resources; and Forest and Soil Conservati on have set-up a separate unit within the ministry to look after DRR issue. Moreover , an institutional mechanism for the post disaster related and coordinatio n activities at regional, district and local levels are already in place. Several I/NGOs have been implementing DRR activities at community level through community based disaster risk management (CBDRM) approach. Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra Likewise, CBDRM has been used not only fo r the DRR activities rather entire development initiatives at the community level. C) The systematic incorporation of risk reduction approaches into the design and implementation of emergen cy preparedness, response and re covery program in the reconstruction of affected communities. Several Municipalities in disaster prone areas have endorsed the Building Code. Likewise, technical staffs of the Munici palities and key Governm ent ministries have received trainings on Buildi ng Code Implementation. Priority for action 1 :- Ensure that disaster risk reduct ion is a national and a local priority with a strong institut ional basis for implementation . A) National policy and legal framework fo r disaster risk reduction exists with decentralized responsibilities and capacities at all levels. Government of Nepal enacted the Natural Disaster Relief Act in 1982, which was revised twice. Despite of the revisions, it fo cuses on post disaster related activities. Soil and Water Conservation Act, 1982, Building Act and other concerned Acts have provisions of some component of DRR. But these legal frameworks are not comprehensive. Still, the role and responsibil ities are not substantially operational zed among agencies and has not fully mainstreamed the pre-disaster activities and DRR in the Acts. However, Ministry of Home A ffairs has prepared the National Strategy for Disaster Risk Management (NSDR M) with the help of stakeholde rs consultations which is approved by the government of Nepal on October 11, 2009. In NSDRM has clearly defined the roles and responsibiliti es at national(central) to lo cal levels ,it is designated new organization structure National Commission for Disaster risk Management (NCDRM)chaired by prime minist er which is institutional mechanism to address the DRR from national to local(community) levels, it is also emphasize establishing the New autonomous body National Authority for Disaster risk Management (NADRM)from central ,regional, district , municipal, local levels with adequate resources, capacity strengthening at systematic, i ndividuals, organizational le vels, and decentralized budget system which is the great achievement on progress of implementation of Hyogo framework for action in Nepal and new DRR Act has been drafted and in pipeline for the approval, which covers all aspects of su stainable DRR, linking disaster with development and climate risk management. B) Dedicated and adequate resources are availabl e to implement disaster risk reduction plans and activities at all administrative levels Resources for DRR are not allocated on pr iority basis. For However, several Government Departments such as, Wate r Induced Disaster Prevention, Soil Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra Conservation and Watershed Management, etc. have been implementing activities related to disaster management. Despite of some activities being implemented both by Government and non-government agencies, a dedicated and predictable budget allocation is not a regular practice in Nepal. C) Community Participation and decentralization is ensured through the delegation of authority and resources to local levels The Local Self-Governance Act (1999) has giv en the authority and re sponsibility to the local government authorities (District Development Committees, Municipalities and Village Development Committees) to design and im plement DRR activities at local level. However, there is no any syst ematic and assured mechanism of resource allocation and distribution to the local authorit ies from the central government. D) A national multi sect oral platform fo r disaster risk reducti on is functioning. The Ministry of Home Affairs has already init iated process to estab lish a multi-sect oral national platform with repr esentative from concerned government agencies, UN agencies, donors, INGOs, NGOs, media, academ ic institutions, private sector, and CBOs. Bringing together to all above mentioned agencies in one pla tform is not an easy task. However, for effectives and efficient di saster management and risk reduction in the country such cooperation and collaboration of a ll actors are imperativ e. Despite of the usefulness of working together in the fiel d of sustainable disaster management/ risk reduction, it seem no concrete initiatives from different sector to form such national level platform comprising members from all wa lks of life to support government to successfully implement the HFA. MOHA in close collaboration with the Nati onal Planning Commission will take leadership role to establish such national platform at the earliest possible and also initiate process to convince the political bodies and individuals. Priority for action 2:- Identify, assess and monitor disaster risks and enhance early warning:- A) National and local risk assessment s based on hazard data and vulnerability information are available and include risk assessments for key sectors. Few agencies (both government and non-governm ent) have initiated local level hazard mapping in few communities. However, such information is scattered and scanty. There is no national level multi-hazard risk assessm ent covering regularly occurring disasters such as floods, landslides, etc. However, a historical record of disaster occurrence called “Desinventar” for last 35 years at natio nal level is available and regularly updated. Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra Unfortunately, no proper use of such in formation on planning and decision making process as of now. Some NGO/INGO are undertaking research projects to better understand local adaptation strat egies to natural hazard risks. International organization such as International Centre for Int egrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has initiated process to assess the socio-econ omic impacts of GLOFs and flash floods through case studies. Similarly, ICIMOD and UNDP together with relevant government agencies have been involved in GLOF hazards assessment and monitoring in specific areas. No initiative by both gov ernment and non-government sect ors to undertake a national level multi-hazard risk assessment cove ring major and annually recurring natural disasters such as flood, landslides, drought, fi re, epidemics, earthquake, etc. Also most of the available information on disaster oc currences has not been used for any planning and decision making purpose. Concerned Government Ministry in cl ose cooperation/ co llaboration with non- government agencies should initiate a national level risk assessment exercise covering major hazards in the country. This single exer cise will enable all agen cies working in the field of DRR to identify the most vulnerable communities, major hazards, disaster prone districts/ VDCs/ communities. This informa tion can also be used for any development planning initiatives in the country. B) Systems are in place to monitor, arch ive and disseminate data on key hazards and vulnerabilities Few agencies at the central and district levels regularly publish and disseminate disaster related information. However, tr ansparent and effective syst ems to monitor and archive of disaster related dat a are still to be institutionalize d. Similarly, as of now the focus to collect information at any level is only limited to any disaster occurrence or post disaster situation. Disaster related information collected and disseminated by different agencies doesn’t tally each other. The data colle ction formats are different for different agencies, the collection level is different, disaggregated info rmation are not available at all levels. Manipulation of information is also a challenge, etc. In normal time, disaster related agencies can work together to develop information collection formats, software, pre-test, et c. Government has developed a Disaster Management Information System (DMIS) in early 2000s, before Desinventar and was in practice in six districts. This DMIS software can be updated and circulated widely for use at all levels. C) Early warning systems is in place for a ll major hazards, with out reach to communities. Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra Few localized single hazard oriented early warn ing systems are in few places for last 2 decades (Tsho Rolpa GLOF, Chit wan Flood, koshi flood, kailali flood landslides in Kabilas village chit wan etc.). However, th ere is no early warning system in place for major hazards Without reach to disast er prone communities (end to end EWS).Technical know-how, financial res ources, trained human resources, and collaboration between governm ent agencies and communities, are the major challenges to establish a fully functional and effectiv e multi-hazard early wa rning system both at central and community levels. Identification of major hazards and institution to deal with such hazard, capacity of su ch identified agency for an effe ctive and efficient early warning, networking with similar organi zation both within and outside country, appropriate policy and institutional mechan ism will help to establish efficient and effective end to end early warning system. Go vernment should initiate/improve public- private partnership for EWS (especially in case of GLOF, flash floods, landslides, earthquakes etc.) and people centered EWS. D) National and local risk assessments take account of regional / Trans boundary risks, with a view to regional c ooperation on risk reduction. National and local levels risk assessment is still a new phenomenon in the country. The need for regional cooperat ion and especially real time data sharing has been recognized by most stakeholders in different forums. Some initiatives have been taken place such as dialogue with India regarding inundation, r egional flood information system initiative, etc. With the support from UNISDR, government of Nepal is undertaking the disaster-poverty interface study. Priority for action 3:- Use knowledge, innovation and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels A) Relevant information on disasters is ava ilable and accessible at all levels, to all stakeholders (through networks, development of inform ation sharing systems etc) Relevant and update information on disasters in the country are scattered and scanty. As of now, through the support of UNDP, histor ical information on disaster occurrences called \"desinventar\" has been colle cting disaster related information for last 36 years (1971-2007) and updated r egularly. Similarly, the Depa rtment of Water Induced Disaster Prevention, Nepal Red Cross Society and few other/NGOs have been collecting and disseminating t he national level information on disasters annually or occasionally. However, as of now there is no any designated and fully functional central and district level data clearance house. Si milarly, there is no any established mechanism to share such available inform ation. Likewise, in many instances, the available information is not utilized fo r new programs /activities design and implementation. Recently, AusAID has fu nded UNDP to support Government of Nepal Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra to establish National Emergency Operations Center for colle cting, collating, analyzing and disseminating information regularly on disasters and coordination. B) School curricula, education material and relevant trainings include disaster risk reduction and recovery concepts and practices. The current school curricula has limited amount of information on disaster management, however they are scattered and does not matc h the need of the country. In 2008, the secondary level of education curricula has recently incorporat ed disaster management component with the support of WWF and other institutions. In addition, so many extra curricula activities related to DRR have been incorporated in the existing secondary level curricula. The Ministry of Educati on (MOE) is reviewing the existing school curricula from grade 6 to 8 and willing to include DRR as a separate chapter. MOE is planning to integrate the DRR component into the teacher training curricula as well. Since the recent past, several I/NGOs hav e been supporting the MO E to incorporate DRR in to School curricula, teacher trai ning on DRR, awareness building classes, publication of various IEC materials on DRR and distribution to schools. Similarly, the Administrative Staff College of the Governm ent has incorporated DRR in most of their training program for government officials C) Research methods and tools for multi-risk assessments and cost benefit analysis are developed and strengthened. Science based disaster risk reduction/ management is a new phenomenon in Nepal. In the recent past, very few government and academ ic institutions have initiated empirical research on cost benefit analysis and mitigation practices in Nepal. However, with the support from UNISDR, Nepal is undertaking a national levels study on the relationship between poverty and disaster and Nepal is pr acticing some internationally accepted and practices tools for retrofitting of buildings and vulnerability assessment. D) Countrywide public awareness strategy exists to stimulate a culture of disaster resilience, with outreach to urban and rural communities. Nepal has been commemorating the IDNDR/UNI SDR Day since the beginning of the IDNDR and the Earthquake Safety Day for lasts several years. Some efforts have been carried out through schoolchildren by the use of IEC materials, quiz context, debate and discussions at the community level. Si milarly, several agencies have been posting/ erecting hording boards on DRR in differ ent locations, organizing folk songs competitions and street dr amas; public announcements thr ough radio and TV, hospital preparedness drills etc .Likewise, few academ ic institutions have been involved in pursuing researches on fire resistant thatch materials, etc. Ho wever, these awareness raising activities are inadequat e to reach to the real mass or the potentially disaster prone communities of the country. Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra Priority for action 4:- Reduce the underlying risk factors A) Disaster risk reduction is an integral objec tive of environment related policies and plans, including for land use natural resource management and adaptation to climate change. The existing natural resources management Ac ts and Acts related to climate change does not include disaster management as an int egral part of it. However, the National Disaster Management Plan developed in 1993 and endorsed by the Government in 1996 emphasized that the need to bring the natural resources management, climate change and development together with disaster management. It is anticipated that National Strategy for Disaste r Risk Management has given syner gy to integrate natural resources management (NRM) and climate change along with sustainable disaster management. B) Social development policies and plans are being implemented to reduce the vulnerability of populations most at risk. Ministry of Health with the technical and fi nancial support from diffe rent agencies has initiated the non-structural vulnerability assessment of hospitals in Nepal and also provided the recommendations to reduce the disa ster risk. However, this initiative has covered only few hospitals. Similarly, there is no other national level initiative to reduce the vulnerability of population most at risk such as insuranc e policy, food security, etc. Government and few non-government agencies have been distributing subsidized food in food insecure areas. Similarly, risk assessment of major public buildings though building code has been implemented in sele cted municipalities as per the Nepal Building Act 2007(amendment). At community level in some disaster prone areas, people have been practicing indigenous resiliency practices. The major challenges to overcome this particula r indicator is also due to lack of proper institution with the mandate, appr opriate policy, lack of technology such as Department of Hydrology and Meteorology can issue weather forecast only for a day and inadequate trained human resources. C) Economic and productive sectoral polic ies and plans have been implemented to reduce the vulnerability of economic activities Despite of the fact that the 10th National Development Plan and the Three Years Interim Development Plan focuses on disaster risk reduction and integrating disaster with development, NO significant activiti es have been designe d and implemented to achieve those objectives mentioned in the National Development Plans. Sect oral policies such as National Agriculture Po licy 2004, National Shelter Policy1996 (2053 BS), National Urban Policy 2006, etc. has inco rporated the disaster issues. However, Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra the implementations of these Acts are weak. The chal lenge include; no any systematic studies and or information to identify the most vulnerable economic activities and productive sectors in the country. Nepal Living Standard Survey 1996 and2003/4 has identified economically vulnerable segments of the society. However, no linkages between economical vulnerability and disaster . Design and pursue empirical studies on the vulnerable economic activities, detail anal ysis. Involve public and private sectors in designing and carrying out such studies/ researches. D) Planning and management of human settlement s incorporate disaster risk reduction elements, including enforcement of building codes. Land-use planning is a significant commitmen t by each and every periodic development plans. Unfortunately, the implem entation and monitoring is weak due to several reasons. Building Code is made compulsory in muni cipal areas. New public buildings have been constructed according to the norms but needs rigorous monitoring mechanism. National Shelter Policy1996 and National Urban Policy 2007 have incorporated to some extent the issue of DRR. Human se ttlement program is not s ubstantially designed and implemented from a building ba ck better. Perspective only policy is formulated and not effectively implemented. E) Disaster risk reduction m easures are integrated into post disaster recovery and rehabilitation processes Fortunately for the last several years, Nepal di d not face any major natural disaster that requires substantial post disast er related activities. Howeve r, the existing policy and practices doesn't include the “Build Back Better\" concept in the post disaster activities. The existing Disaster Management Act (1982) has overlooked the planning and management of human settlements incorpor ated DRR elements. The proposed revision of the DM Act is taking more time than ex pected for its endorsement . Either revision of the existing DM Act with clear provisio n of DRR element in the planning and management of human settlements and enforcem ent of the Building Code or enactment of new DM Act embedding the DRR issue in the human settlement component and Building Code. Capacity building at all levels. F) Procedures are in place to assess the di saster risk impacts of major development projects, especially infrastructure. Government is aware of the need to inco rporate and institutional ize disaster impact assessment (DIA) in major projects during it s design phase such as EIA. However, it needs substantial revision of t he existing DM Act or enforcem ent of new Act. Make DIA compulsory in all developm ent projects and programs. Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra Priority for action 5:- Strengthen disaster preparedn ess for effective response at all levels A) Strong policy, technical and institutional capacities and me chanisms for disaster risk management, with a disaster risk reduc tion perspective are in place. The current DM Act (1982) focuses on the post disaster activities. However, since the second World Conference on Disaster Reducti on, Government of Nepal has initiated processes to reformulate its DRM/R policy and institutional mechanism though a very consultative/ participatory processes. The new DRM Act and the Strategy encompasses all elements of disaster management cycle, long term and sustainable disaster risk reduction/ management and linking disaster with development. The proposed Act and strategy also strongly emphasized the est ablishment of a national framework for disaster risk management which include s establishment of autonomous DRM authorities from the central level (NAD RM as an apex body) through all levels. Institutional commitment is r equired for the effective impl ementation of the plans and policy. It is also necessary to ensure co mpatibility between Act and the strategy for DRM. Nepal went through a violent social transfo rmation process over the last 13 years. Therefore, the entire gover nment machinery was engaged in peace process. This peace process sidelined the disaster related in itiatives in the country. Similarly, the unavailability of predictable am ount of government resour ces for program design and implementation also jeopardi zed the formulation of poli cy, establishment of an appropriate institution and capac ity building activities. Despite such conditions Nepal has implemented several good practices, met hodology and templates which technically, socially and economically feasible. The real challenge is to upscale these practices through massive capacity building and creati on of working conducive legal and policy environment at all levels. La ck of implementation mechanis m is a challenge from the VDC level to the central level in every sector. Focusing to policy and decision makers. Appropriate regulations comme nsurate with the act and strat egy should be developed and integrated in the governance process at all levels from village to the national, to ensure incorporation of DRR into all dev elopment planning and implementation. This entails that all infrastructure s are made disaster resilient all critical facilities are functional even after the disaster. Appropr iate guidelines and \"How to use such Guidelines\" should be developed and use for training. B) Disaster preparedness plans and contingency pl ans are in place at all administrative levels, and regular training drills and rehearsa ls are held to test and develop disaster response programs. Nepal 2009 Compiled by Sagar Mishra Few districts of Nepal have developed Dis trict Disaster Management Plan based on GIS information during early 2000s. However, due to lack of coordination, technical capability, etc. these plans were not fully implemented an d monitored. Similarly, Nepal developed the National DM Pl an in 1993, which was presented during the First World Conference on Disaster Reduction (1994) and endorsed by Government in 1996. However, due to several reasons and laps, the activities were not successfully implement and monitored. Since then, several agenci es both government and non- government are working in the field of DR M/R in a much more uncoordinated manner and without developing any plan at all levels. Preparedness planning is still to be incorporated at VDC, Munici pality and even district levels . Few prepositioning of relief materials have been experimented mainly in Kathmandu valley and this need to be expanded to other prone and densely populated ar eas. NRCS has warehouses to store food and non food items at strategic locations for emergency use. This network of stocks should be expanded at leas t to all districts and possibl y to the VDC level. This should accompanied by appropriate capacit y building for inventory, periodically replenishment of supplies, and operation of preposition of the materials. Government should provide enabling environment for yout h to work as volunteers in disaster preparedness and response. The major challenges includes the poor realization of a need of planned disaster risk reduction/ management and linki ng disaster with development; inadequate capacity at all levels; motivation of staff engaged, implementation, allocation of fund for program design and im plementation etc. C) Financial reserves and contingency mechanisms are in place to support effective response and recovery when required. The Government has two sources of funding for response and recovery activities; The Prime Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund and the Ministry of Home Affair's regular disaster relief fund.
